            <h2 class="sechead">ROGUES GALLERY</h2>
 
            <p class="text">The Rogues Gallery is the term for the various villains that Batman has faced over the years. These have ranged from costumed villains like the Joker, Poison Ivy and Two-Face, plainclothes crime bosses like Rupert Thorne, Carmine Falcone and Joe Chill to lesser known foes such as Magpie, Killer Moth and Humpty Dumpty.

                <br><br> As enemies of the Batman are often sympathetic or otherwise morally complex, he is also known to be enemies with anti-heroic allies such as Catwoman, Azrael or the Red Hood.</p><br><br>

                <h2 class="desc">JOKER</h2>
            </div>
                <p class="text">The Joker possesses no superhuman abilities, instead using his expertise in chemical engineering to develop poisonous or lethal concoctions and thematic weaponry, including razor-tipped playing cards, deadly joy buzzers, and acid-spraying lapel flowers. The Joker sometimes works with other Gotham City supervillains, such as the Penguin and Two-Face, and groups like the Injustice Gang and Injustice League, but these relationships often collapse due to the Joker's desire for unbridled chaos. A romantic interest for the Joker, his former psychiatrist and sidekick Harley Quinn, was introduced in the 1990s. Although his primary obsession is Batman, the Joker has also fought other heroes, including Superman and Wonder Woman.</p><br><br>

                <h2 class="desc">RIDDLER</h2>
            </div>
                <p class="text"> the Riddler is depicted as a criminal mastermind in Gotham City. He has an obsessive compulsion to incorporate riddles, puzzles, and death traps in his schemes to prove his intellectual superiority over Batman and the police. His real name–Edward Nigma–is a pun itself; an "enigma" is a person or thing that is difficult to understand. With this self-conscious use of an elaborate gimmick, the Riddler's crimes are often theatrical and ostentatious. The character commonly wears a domino mask and either a green unitard decorated with question mark prints or a green suit and bowler hat. A black, green, or purple question mark serves as his visual motif. He commonly says "Riddle me this," before stating his iconic riddles.</p><br><br>

                <h2 class="desc">PENGUIN</h2>
            </div>
                <p class="text">The Penguin is a Gotham City mobster who fancies himself the number one "Gentleman of Crime". He is most often seen as a short, fat man with a long nose who wears a monocle, top hat, and morning suit while carrying his signature umbrella. He also has a cigarette holder in his mouth. Penguin uses high-tech umbrellas as different tools. His umbrellas have been used as guns, gas, swords/knives, a mini-helicopter and many other unconventional tools. The Penguin owns and runs a nightclub called the Iceberg Lounge which provides a cover for his criminal activity.</p><br><br>
            
            <div class="bg bg4">
                <h2 class="desc">TWO FACE</h2>
            </div>
                <p class="text">Two-Face is the alter ego of Harvey Dent, Gotham City's former district attorney who becomes a criminal mastermind obsessed with duality and the number two. Half of his face is hideously scarred after mob boss Sal Maroni throws acid at him. The resulting disfigurement drives him insane and causes him to make decisions based on the flip of a coin. The Modern Age of Comic Books portrays the character as having dissociative identity disorder, with Two-Face being an alternate personality that developed as a result of childhood abuse. The modern version is also established as having once been an ally of Batman and Commissioner James Gordon, and a close friend of Batman's secret identity, Bruce Wayne.</p>
